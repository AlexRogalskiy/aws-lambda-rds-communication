# Connect RDS with AWS lambda function 

This code illustrates how you can connect a RDS instance with the help of lambda function written in java.

## Useful Intellij Plugin

For local debugging I have used AWS toolkit plugin: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11349-aws-toolkit

For debugging AWS lambda function locally you would have to install AWS SAM Cli. Installation can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html
